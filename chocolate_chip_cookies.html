    <h2>Whoa those look good...</h2>
    <p>Yeah you see this shit? These are "Toll House" chocolate chip cookies.
        But dig <em>this</em>- 
        I'm gonna tell you how to make these bad boys from
        scratch; so you <strong>won't</strong> have to support Nestle's bitchass
        by buying their pre-made dough.
        That's right. We're gonna snag that Nestle <em>taste</em>
        without having to deal with that Nestle <strong>guilt.</strong>
